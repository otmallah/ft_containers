## Description

ft_containers is a project written in C++ which require you to reimplement a few containers from the STL.

They must have all public member functions from C++98.

The corresponding iterators must also be implemented.

## Containers

#### vector

The C++ Standard Library vector class is a class template for sequence containers. A vector stores elements of a given type in a linear arrangement, and allows fast random access to any element. A vector is the preferred container for a sequence when random-access performance is at a premium
